Music - Composition Techniques

Musical composition creates original works through melody, harmony, rhythm, and form. Melodic writing considers contour, phrasing, and motivic development. Harmonic progression uses chord relationships and voice leading principles. Rhythmic patterns create momentum and character through meter, syncopation, and accent placement. Orchestration assigns musical lines to appropriate instruments considering range, timbre, and technical capabilities. Counterpoint combines independent melodic lines creating polyphonic textures. Modern techniques include atonality, serialism, and electronic manipulation. Composition software assists notation, playback, and editing. Creative process involves inspiration, development, and revision.
