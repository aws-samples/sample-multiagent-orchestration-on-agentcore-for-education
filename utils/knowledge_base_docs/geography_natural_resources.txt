Geography - Natural Resources

Natural resources are materials and energy sources found in nature that humans use for economic activities. Renewable resources include solar, wind, water, and forests. Non-renewable resources include fossil fuels, minerals, and metals. Resource distribution affects economic development and international trade patterns. Sustainable resource management balances economic needs with environmental conservation. Resource depletion, pollution, and climate change challenge global sustainability. Alternative energy sources and recycling help reduce resource consumption and environmental impact.
