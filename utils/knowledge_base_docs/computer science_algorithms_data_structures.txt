Computer Science - Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems efficiently. Time complexity measures algorithm performance using Big O notation. Common algorithms include sorting (quicksort, mergesort), searching (binary search), and graph traversal (breadth-first, depth-first). Data structures organize information for efficient access and modification. Arrays provide indexed storage, linked lists enable dynamic sizing, stacks follow last-in-first-out, and queues use first-in-first-out. Trees organize hierarchical data, while hash tables provide fast key-value lookup. Choosing appropriate algorithms and data structures optimizes program performance and resource usage.
