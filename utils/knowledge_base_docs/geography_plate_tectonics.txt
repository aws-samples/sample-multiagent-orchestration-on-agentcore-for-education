Geography - Plate Tectonics

Plate tectonics theory explains Earth's surface dynamics through the movement of lithospheric plates. This process shapes continents, creates mountains, and causes earthquakes and volcanic activity.

Key concepts:
- Lithospheric plates: Large rock slabs floating on the mantle
- Plate boundaries: Divergent (spreading), convergent (colliding), transform (sliding)
- Continental drift: Continents move over geological time
- Seafloor spreading: New oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges
- Subduction zones: Oceanic plates sink beneath continental plates
- Ring of Fire: Volcanic and seismic activity around Pacific Ocean

Plate tectonics explains the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain ranges, and mineral resources, influencing human settlement patterns and natural hazards.
