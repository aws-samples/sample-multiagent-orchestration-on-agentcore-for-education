English - Grammar and Syntax

Grammar provides the structural rules governing language use, while syntax arranges words into meaningful sentences. Parts of speech include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. Sentence structures range from simple to complex, compound, and compound-complex forms. Verb tenses indicate time relationships and aspectual meanings. Subject-verb agreement, pronoun reference, and modifier placement ensure clarity. Punctuation marks organize ideas and indicate pauses, emphasis, and relationships. Understanding grammar improves writing clarity, reading comprehension, and effective communication across contexts.
