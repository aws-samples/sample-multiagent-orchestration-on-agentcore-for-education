Physical Education - Nutrition and Fitness

Nutrition supports fitness goals through proper fuel for exercise performance and recovery. Macronutrients include carbohydrates for energy, proteins for muscle repair, and fats for sustained energy. Micronutrients like vitamins and minerals support metabolic processes. Hydration maintains body temperature, joint lubrication, and nutrient transport. Pre-exercise nutrition provides energy while post-exercise nutrition aids recovery. Weight management balances caloric intake with energy expenditure. Supplements may support specific needs but whole foods provide optimal nutrition. Proper nutrition enhances performance, reduces injury risk, and promotes long-term health.
