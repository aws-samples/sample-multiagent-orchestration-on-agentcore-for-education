Biology - Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. This process sustains most life on Earth by providing food and oxygen.

Photosynthesis equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Two main stages:
- Light reactions: Chlorophyll captures light, splits water, produces ATP and NADPH
- Calvin cycle: CO₂ fixation into glucose using ATP and NADPH
- Occurs in chloroplasts, primarily in leaf mesophyll cells
- Chlorophyll a and b absorb different light wavelengths

Photosynthesis forms the base of food chains, removes atmospheric CO₂, and produces oxygen essential for aerobic respiration in most organisms.
