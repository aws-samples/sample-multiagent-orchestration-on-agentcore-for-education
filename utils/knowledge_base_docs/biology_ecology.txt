Biology - Ecology and Ecosystems

Ecology studies interactions between organisms and their environment. Ecosystems consist of biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components that cycle energy and nutrients.

Ecological levels of organization:
- Individual: Single organism
- Population: Same species in an area
- Community: All species in an area
- Ecosystem: Community plus physical environment
- Biosphere: All ecosystems on Earth

Energy flows through trophic levels (producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, decomposers). Nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) recycle essential elements. Understanding ecology guides conservation, agriculture, and environmental management.
