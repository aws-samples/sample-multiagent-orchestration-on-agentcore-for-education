Literature - Narrative Structure

Narrative structure organizes story elements including plot, character, setting, point of view, and theme. Plot follows exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution patterns. Character development shows protagonist growth through conflict and change. Setting establishes time, place, and atmosphere. Point of view determines narrative perspective through first, second, or third person narration. Themes convey deeper meanings about human nature and society. Narrative techniques include flashbacks, foreshadowing, symbolism, and unreliable narrators creating complex storytelling effects.
