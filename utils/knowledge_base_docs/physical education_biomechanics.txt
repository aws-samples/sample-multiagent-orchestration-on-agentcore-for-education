Physical Education - Biomechanics in Sports

Biomechanics applies mechanical principles to human movement in sports and exercise. Force production involves muscle contractions creating internal forces against external resistance. Lever systems in the body amplify force or speed through bone-joint-muscle arrangements. Motion analysis examines linear and angular kinematics including velocity, acceleration, and displacement. Newton's laws explain force-motion relationships in athletic movements. Projectile motion affects throwing, jumping, and striking activities. Injury prevention considers proper technique, equipment design, and movement patterns. Performance enhancement optimizes efficiency, power, and skill execution through biomechanical analysis.
