Chemistry - Chemical Bonding

Chemical bonds form when atoms share or transfer electrons to achieve stable electron configurations. Bond types determine molecular geometry, properties, and reactivity.

Types of chemical bonds:
- Ionic bonds: Electron transfer between metals and nonmetals
- Covalent bonds: Electron sharing between nonmetals
- Metallic bonds: Delocalized electrons in metal lattices
- Hydrogen bonds: Weak attractions involving hydrogen atoms
- Van der Waals forces: Weak intermolecular attractions

Bond polarity, electronegativity differences, and molecular geometry influence physical properties like melting point, solubility, and conductivity in chemical compounds.
