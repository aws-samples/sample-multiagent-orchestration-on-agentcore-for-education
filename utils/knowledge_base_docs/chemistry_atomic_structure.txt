Chemistry - Atomic Structure

Atoms consist of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in orbitals. Understanding atomic structure explains chemical bonding, periodic trends, and molecular behavior.

Key components:
- Protons: Positive charge, determine element identity
- Neutrons: No charge, contribute to atomic mass
- Electrons: Negative charge, occupy energy levels and orbitals
- Electron configuration: Distribution of electrons in atomic orbitals
- Quantum numbers: n, l, ml, ms describe electron states

Atomic structure determines chemical properties, bonding patterns, and reactivity. The periodic table organizes elements by atomic number, revealing periodic trends in properties.
