Chemistry - Chemical Kinetics

Chemical kinetics studies reaction rates and mechanisms. It explains how fast reactions occur and what factors influence reaction speed, crucial for industrial processes and biological systems.

Key factors affecting reaction rates:
- Concentration: Higher concentrations increase collision frequency
- Temperature: Higher temperatures increase molecular kinetic energy
- Catalysts: Lower activation energy without being consumed
- Surface area: Greater surface area increases reaction sites
- Pressure: Affects gaseous reactions

Rate laws express reaction rate dependence on reactant concentrations. Understanding kinetics enables optimization of chemical processes, drug metabolism, and enzyme function.
