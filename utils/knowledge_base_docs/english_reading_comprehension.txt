English - Reading Comprehension Strategies

Reading comprehension involves understanding, interpreting, and evaluating written texts through active engagement strategies. Pre-reading activities include previewing, predicting, and activating prior knowledge. During reading, strategies include questioning, visualizing, making connections, and monitoring understanding. Post-reading activities involve summarizing, analyzing, and synthesizing information. Critical reading evaluates author credibility, bias, and argument strength. Different text types require adapted approaches for fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and technical writing. Vocabulary development through context clues, word analysis, and dictionary use supports comprehension.
