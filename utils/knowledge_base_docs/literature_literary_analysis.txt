Literature - Literary Analysis and Criticism

Literary analysis examines texts through various critical lenses including formalism, structuralism, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches. Close reading techniques focus on language, imagery, symbolism, and narrative structure. Themes explore universal human experiences like love, death, power, and identity. Literary devices include metaphor, irony, foreshadowing, and allegory. Genre conventions shape reader expectations in poetry, drama, and prose. Historical and cultural contexts influence interpretation. Literary criticism evolves with changing social perspectives and theoretical frameworks.
