Physical Education - Exercise Physiology

Exercise physiology studies how the body responds and adapts to physical activity. Cardiovascular adaptations include increased heart rate, stroke volume, and oxygen delivery during exercise. Respiratory system changes involve deeper breathing and improved oxygen uptake. Muscular adaptations include strength gains, endurance improvements, and hypertrophy. Energy systems provide fuel through phosphocreatine, glycolysis, and aerobic metabolism. Training principles include overload, specificity, progression, and recovery. Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health, muscular fitness, flexibility, and body composition while reducing disease risk.
