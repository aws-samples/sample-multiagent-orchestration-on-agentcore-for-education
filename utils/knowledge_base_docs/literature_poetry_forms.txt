Literature - Poetry Forms and Techniques

Poetry employs various forms and techniques to create meaning and aesthetic effect. Traditional forms include sonnets, haikus, villanelles, and ballads with specific rhyme schemes and meter patterns. Free verse poetry abandons formal constraints for natural speech rhythms. Poetic devices include alliteration, assonance, consonance, and onomatopoeia. Figurative language uses metaphors, similes, personification, and hyperbole. Line breaks, stanza structure, and white space create visual and rhythmic effects. Contemporary poetry experiments with multimedia, concrete poetry, and spoken word performance.
