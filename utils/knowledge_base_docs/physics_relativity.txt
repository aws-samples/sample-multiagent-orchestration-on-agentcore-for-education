Physics - Theory of Relativity

Einstein's relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity (1905) deals with objects moving at constant high speeds, while general relativity (1915) describes gravity as spacetime curvature.

Special relativity principles:
- Speed of light is constant in all reference frames
- Time dilation: moving clocks run slower
- Length contraction: moving objects appear shorter
- Mass-energy equivalence: E = mc²

General relativity explains gravity as curved spacetime caused by mass-energy. It predicts black holes, gravitational waves, and GPS satellite corrections, fundamentally changing cosmology and astrophysics.
