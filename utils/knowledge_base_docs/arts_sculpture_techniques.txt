Arts - Sculpture Techniques and Materials

Sculpture creates three-dimensional art through various techniques and materials. Subtractive methods remove material from stone, wood, or other substances through carving. Additive methods build up forms using clay, plaster, or mixed media. Casting reproduces forms in bronze, aluminum, or other metals. Assemblage combines found objects and diverse materials. Traditional materials include marble, bronze, wood, and clay. Contemporary materials incorporate plastics, metals, and digital fabrication. Sculptural considerations include form, space, texture, and scale. Public sculpture addresses site-specific contexts and community engagement.
