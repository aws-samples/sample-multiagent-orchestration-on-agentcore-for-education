English - Linguistics and Language Study

Linguistics scientifically studies language structure, use, and change across cultures and time. Phonetics examines speech sounds, while phonology studies sound patterns. Morphology analyzes word formation through roots, prefixes, and suffixes. Semantics explores meaning relationships and word definitions. Pragmatics considers context, intention, and social factors in communication. Sociolinguistics examines language variation across social groups, regions, and situations. Historical linguistics traces language evolution and family relationships. Applied linguistics addresses language teaching, translation, and communication disorders.
