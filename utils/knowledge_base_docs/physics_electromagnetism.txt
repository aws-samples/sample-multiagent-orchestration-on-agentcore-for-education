Physics - Electromagnetism

Electromagnetism unifies electric and magnetic phenomena through Maxwell's equations. It describes how charged particles create fields and how changing fields generate forces and currents.

Maxwell's equations:
- Gauss's law: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
- Gauss's law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0
- Faraday's law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
- Ampère-Maxwell law: ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t

These equations predict electromagnetic waves traveling at light speed, explaining radio, microwaves, visible light, and X-rays. Applications include motors, generators, transformers, antennas, and wireless communication systems.
