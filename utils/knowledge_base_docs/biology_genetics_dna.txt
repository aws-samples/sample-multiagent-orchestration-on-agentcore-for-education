Biology - Genetics and DNA

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) carries genetic information in all living organisms. The double helix structure contains the instructions for building and maintaining life through protein synthesis.

DNA structure and function:
- Double helix: Two complementary strands (A-T, G-C base pairs)
- Genes: DNA sequences coding for specific proteins
- Chromosomes: Organized DNA structures in cell nucleus
- Replication: DNA copying during cell division
- Transcription: DNA to RNA information transfer
- Translation: RNA to protein synthesis

Genetic variations drive evolution, inheritance patterns, and individual differences. Understanding genetics enables medical treatments, agricultural improvements, and biotechnology applications.
