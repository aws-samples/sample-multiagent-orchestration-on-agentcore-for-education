Mathematics - Euclidean Geometry

Euclidean geometry, based on Euclid's axioms, studies properties of flat surfaces and three-dimensional space. It forms the foundation for classical geometry and spatial reasoning.

Key principles:
- Points, lines, and planes are fundamental elements
- Parallel postulate: Through a point not on a line, exactly one parallel line exists
- Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c² for right triangles
- Circle properties: circumference = 2πr, area = πr²
- Angle relationships: complementary (90°), supplementary (180°)

Euclidean geometry applies to architecture, engineering, computer graphics, and navigation systems.
