Mathematics - Probability Theory

Probability theory studies the likelihood of events occurring. The probability of an event A is denoted P(A) and ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

Fundamental concepts:
- Sample space: Set of all possible outcomes
- Event: Subset of sample space
- Conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)
- Independence: P(A∩B) = P(A)×P(B)
- Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A)×P(A)/P(B)

Probability distributions describe how probabilities are distributed over possible values, essential for statistics and data analysis.
