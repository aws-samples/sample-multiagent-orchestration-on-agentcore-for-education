Biology - Cell Structure and Function

Cells are the fundamental units of life, containing organized structures called organelles that perform specific functions. Understanding cell structure explains how life processes occur at the molecular level.

Key organelles and functions:
- Nucleus: Contains DNA and controls cell activities
- Mitochondria: Powerhouses producing ATP energy
- Ribosomes: Protein synthesis sites
- Endoplasmic reticulum: Protein and lipid processing
- Golgi apparatus: Modifies and packages proteins
- Cell membrane: Controls substance entry and exit

Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have complex internal organization. Cell structure determines function in tissues, organs, and organisms.
