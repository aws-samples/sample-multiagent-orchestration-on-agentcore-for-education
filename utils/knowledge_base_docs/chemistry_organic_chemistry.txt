Chemistry - Organic Chemistry

Organic chemistry studies carbon-containing compounds, which form the basis of all living organisms. Carbon's ability to form four bonds creates diverse molecular structures and functions.

Fundamental concepts:
- Hydrocarbons: Compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen
- Functional groups: Reactive molecular fragments (alcohols, aldehydes, carboxyls)
- Isomerism: Same molecular formula, different structures
- Reaction mechanisms: Step-by-step bond breaking and forming
- Stereochemistry: Three-dimensional molecular arrangements

Organic chemistry explains biological processes, pharmaceutical design, polymer synthesis, and petrochemical production. It bridges chemistry with biology, medicine, and materials science.
