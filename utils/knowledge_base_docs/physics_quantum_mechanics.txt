Physics - Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical physics, quantum systems exhibit wave-particle duality and probabilistic behavior.

Key principles:
- Wave function ψ describes quantum state probabilities
- Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2
- Superposition: Particles exist in multiple states simultaneously
- Quantum entanglement: Correlated particles affect each other instantly
- Schrödinger equation: iħ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ

Quantum mechanics enables technologies like lasers, MRI machines, computer processors, and emerging quantum computers for cryptography and simulation.
