Mathematics - Number Theory

Number theory studies properties and relationships of integers. It explores prime numbers, divisibility, and modular arithmetic, with applications in cryptography and computer science.

Core concepts:
- Prime numbers: Natural numbers greater than 1 with exactly two divisors
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): Largest number dividing two integers
- Modular arithmetic: Arithmetic with remainders (a ≡ b (mod n))
- Fermat's Little Theorem: If p is prime, then a^p ≡ a (mod p)
- Euler's totient function: φ(n) counts integers coprime to n

Number theory underlies RSA encryption, hash functions, and digital signatures in cybersecurity.
