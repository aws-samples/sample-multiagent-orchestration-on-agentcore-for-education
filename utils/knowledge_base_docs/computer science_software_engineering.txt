Computer Science - Software Engineering

Software engineering applies systematic approaches to designing, developing, and maintaining large-scale software systems. Software development lifecycle includes requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance phases. Agile methodologies emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Version control systems track code changes and enable team collaboration. Testing strategies include unit testing, integration testing, and system testing ensuring software quality. Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common programming problems. Project management coordinates resources, timelines, and deliverables. Software engineering principles ensure reliable, maintainable, and scalable applications.
