Chemistry - Thermochemistry

Thermochemistry studies energy changes during chemical reactions. It quantifies heat absorbed or released, helping predict reaction spontaneity and optimize industrial processes.

Key concepts:
- Enthalpy (H): Heat content at constant pressure
- Enthalpy of formation: Energy to form compounds from elements
- Enthalpy of combustion: Energy released during complete burning
- Hess's law: Total enthalpy change is path-independent
- Calorimetry: Experimental measurement of heat changes

Thermochemical data enables calculation of reaction energetics, fuel efficiency, and process optimization in chemical manufacturing, energy production, and environmental applications.
