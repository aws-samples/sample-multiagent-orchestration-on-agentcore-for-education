Geography - Urban Geography

Urban geography studies cities and metropolitan areas, examining spatial patterns, population distribution, and urban development. Key concepts include urbanization processes, central place theory, urban morphology, and land use patterns. Cities exhibit concentric zones, sectors, and multiple nuclei models. Urban planning addresses transportation, housing, commercial districts, and green spaces. Megacities and urban sprawl present challenges like traffic congestion, pollution, and social inequality. Sustainable urban development focuses on smart cities, public transportation, and environmental conservation.
