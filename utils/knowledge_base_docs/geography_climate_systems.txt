Geography - Climate Systems

Climate systems involve complex interactions between atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Understanding climate patterns helps predict weather, agriculture, and environmental changes.

Climate factors:
- Latitude: Distance from equator affects solar radiation
- Altitude: Higher elevations have cooler temperatures
- Ocean currents: Distribute heat around the globe
- Topography: Mountains create rain shadows and wind patterns
- Atmospheric circulation: Trade winds, westerlies, polar easterlies
- Greenhouse effect: Atmospheric gases trap heat

Climate zones include tropical, temperate, polar, and arid regions. Climate change affects precipitation patterns, temperature extremes, and ecosystem distribution globally.
