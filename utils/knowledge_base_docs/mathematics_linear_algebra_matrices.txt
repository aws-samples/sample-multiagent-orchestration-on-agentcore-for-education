Mathematics - Linear Algebra: Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrix operations form the foundation of linear algebra and have applications in computer graphics, machine learning, and engineering.

Basic matrix operations:
- Addition: Add corresponding elements
- Multiplication: Row-by-column multiplication rule
- Transpose: Flip rows and columns
- Determinant: Scalar value representing matrix properties
- Inverse: Matrix A^(-1) where AA^(-1) = I

Matrices can represent linear transformations, solve systems of equations, and model complex relationships in data science.
