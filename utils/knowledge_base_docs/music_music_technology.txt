Music - Music Technology

Music technology integrates electronic tools with traditional musical practices, expanding creative possibilities and accessibility. Digital audio workstations (DAWs) enable recording, editing, and mixing. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) connects electronic instruments and computers. Synthesizers generate sounds through various synthesis methods. Sampling captures and manipulates recorded audio. Auto-tune and pitch correction modify vocal performances. Live sound reinforcement uses microphones, mixers, and speakers. Music software includes notation programs, virtual instruments, and effects processors. Streaming platforms distribute music globally. Technology democratizes music creation while raising questions about authenticity and artistic value.
