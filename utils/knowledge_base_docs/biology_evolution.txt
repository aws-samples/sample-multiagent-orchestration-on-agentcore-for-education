Biology - Theory of Evolution

Evolution explains how species change over time through natural selection, genetic drift, and other mechanisms. It unifies all biological sciences by explaining the diversity and unity of life.

Key evolutionary concepts:
- Natural selection: Survival and reproduction of the fittest
- Genetic variation: Raw material for evolutionary change
- Adaptation: Traits that improve survival and reproduction
- Speciation: Formation of new species from existing ones
- Common descent: All life shares common ancestors
- Fossil record: Evidence of evolutionary history

Evolution explains antibiotic resistance, biodiversity patterns, comparative anatomy, and molecular similarities across species. It guides conservation efforts and medical research.
