Geography - Human Migration

Human migration involves permanent or temporary movement of people across geographic boundaries. Push factors include war, poverty, persecution, and natural disasters. Pull factors include economic opportunities, political freedom, and family reunification. Migration types include voluntary, forced, internal, and international movements. Brain drain occurs when skilled workers leave developing countries. Remittances from migrants support origin communities. Migration affects cultural diversity, labor markets, and demographic patterns in both origin and destination areas.
