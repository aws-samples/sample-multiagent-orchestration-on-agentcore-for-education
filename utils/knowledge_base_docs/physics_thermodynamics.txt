Physics - Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics studies heat, work, and energy transfer in systems. It governs everything from steam engines to biological processes and stellar evolution.

Four fundamental laws:
- Zeroth law: Thermal equilibrium is transitive
- First law: Energy conservation (ΔU = Q - W)
- Second law: Entropy always increases in isolated systems
- Third law: Entropy approaches zero at absolute zero temperature

Key concepts include temperature, pressure, volume, enthalpy, and entropy. Thermodynamics explains engine efficiency, refrigeration cycles, phase transitions, and chemical reaction spontaneity in industrial and natural processes.
